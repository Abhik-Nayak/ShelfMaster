# test_Todo
Create a simple CRUD to-do list where users can manage their todo list. Users can login to their account where they can manage the todos. Registration is not not required (just provide some sample credentials to test). Design is not important (just make sure that the links are provided in the page). Use jwt to create tokens. 

Note :
Clone the repository first
In server Folder add mongodb Usernam and password Like 
    MONGO_DB_USER=Username
    MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=Password
